# Introduction

Most of the cases reading an academic 
paper is a time consuming process. Considering the limited time a student has, it will be really challenging to read a
huge amount of material in daily bases. In this lecutre we will introduce you the tools to read and summarize the papers.
Before comming to the lecture please review the meterials introduced here.

# Tips to Read Academic Papers

1. Donâ€™t read from Introduction to Conclusion.
2. Look at the information about the article (title, author, abstract, citation)
3. Skim the Introduction
4. Glance at section headings
5. Review Discussion/Conclusions sections
6. Read through the other sections

# Scholarcy

Scholarcy is an **AI-powered summarizing tool** that can help you quickly summarize research articles, reports, and book chapters in seconds.
It uses advanced machine learning algorithms to identify key information such as study participants, data analyses, main findings, and limitations, 
and breaks them down into bite-sized sections. This way, you can quickly assess how important any document is to your work and save hundreds of hours. 
Scholarcy can also create a summary flashcard of any article, report, or document in Word or PDF format, and extract the key facts, figures, and 
references in seconds. Scholarcy's browser extension for Chrome and Edge works with open-access repositories such as 
arXiv, biorXiv, and OSF Preprints. It also integrates with Scholarcy Library, a pay-monthly subscription service that builds a 
searchable collection of your summary cards, accessible from any device.
