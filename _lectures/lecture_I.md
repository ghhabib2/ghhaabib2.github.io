- [Lecture I (2023-09-11 09:00 AM)](https://mcmaster.zoom.us/j/5561269267)

# Introduction

Searching for scientific articles when starting a research is one of the most challenging tasks, especially if you are in your first year of research. In this lecture, we will learn how to perform a search using a non-intelligent search engine for academic resources, and then we will explore a more advanced tool to conduct a more profound and intelligent search.

# How to search for academic resources

Assume that you are about to begin a research project and your supervisor has instructed you to find and read at least five recent publications on the given topic. However, you may be unsure of how to proceed. Should you simply search for the topic on Google? What should you be searching for exactly? What should you avoid searching for? Although this topic may not have been covered in your lecture, we suggest that you watch this video to become familiar with the necessary skills for searching academic resources.
