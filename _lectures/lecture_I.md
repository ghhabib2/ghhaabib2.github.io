# Zoom Meeting Link

- [Lecture I (2023-01-11 09:00 AM)](https://mcmaster.zoom.us/j/5561269267)

# Introduction

Searching for the scietific articiles when we are starting a research
is one of the hardest things to do. Specifically if you are in your first
yeard of the research it will be harder. 

In this lecture we will have a look at how we can do a search using a none-intlligent
search engine for academic resources, then we will have a look at one tool that will
help you to do a more in depth and more intelligent search.

# How to search for academic resources

Lets assume you are going to start a research, your supervisor asked you **to
find five recent publication about the topic and read them.** This is the new challenge
for you since you don't know how to do this. Should you start **googling** for the topic?
What you should search for? What you should not search for? This is not in the scope of the
lecture but we will suggest you to look at this video to become familar with searching skills
for academic resources:

# Semantic Scholar

In this lecture we will introduce **Semantic Scholar**. An academic resource searching tool
that go beyond simple search. Based on the limited time we have in the class it will be great if
have a look at the following introductory video. We will discuss about this more in the class.
