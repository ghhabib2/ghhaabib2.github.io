# Introduction

Starting a research project can be a bit overwhelming, especially when it comes to understanding the existing work in the area
of research you're planning to work on. You need to figure out what the open problems are and navigate through a bunch of papers to get
a sense of the research history. But, don't worry, we're here to help you out! We'll provide you with some information on software tools
that can simplify this part of your research journey. 

# Tips for Writing a Literature Review

1. **Narrow your topic and select papers accordingly:** Consider your specific area of study. Think about what interests you and what interests other researchers in your field.
2. **Search for literature:** Define your source selection criteria (ie. articles published between a specific date range, focusing on a specific geographic region, or using a specific methodology). Look at lecture I for how to do the search.
3. **Read the selected articles thoroughly and evaluate them:** Evaluate and synthesize the studies' Ô¨Åndings and conclusions. We itroduced some references in the first lecture about how to read academic papers.
4. **Organize the selected papers by looking for patterns and by developing subtopics**
5. **Develop a thesis or purpose statement**
6. **Write the paper**
7. **Review your work**

# Connected Papers

Connected Papers is a tool for thought to help researchers and applied scientists find and explore papers relevant to their field of work in a visual way. You enter an origin paper, and they generate a graph. To achieve this, they analyse about 50,000 research papers, and select the ones with the strongest connections to the origin paper.

Created by Alex Tarnavsky, Eitan Eddie Smolyansky, and Itay Knaan Harpaz from Israel, Connected Papers started as a weekend side project. But when the three friends realised how useful it was in their own research, and how their friends and colleagues kept on asking to use it, they decided to release the tool for the public.
