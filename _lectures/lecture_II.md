# Introduction

A literature review is a summary of the published work in a field of study. This can be a section of a larger paper or article, or can be the focus of an entire paper. Literature reviews show that you have examined the breadth of knowledge and can justify your thesis or research questions. In todays lecture we introduce ML 

# Tips for writing a liturature review

1. **Narrow your topic and select papers accordingly:** Consider your specific area of study. Think about what interests you and what interests other researchers in your field.
2. **Search for literature:** Define your source selection criteria (ie. articles published between a specific date range, focusing on a specific geographic region, or using a specific methodology). Look at lecture I for how to do the search.
3. **Read the selected articles thoroughly and evaluate them:** Evaluate and synthesize the studies' Ô¨Åndings and conclusions. We itroduced some references in the first lecture about how to read academic papers.
4. **Organize the selected papers by looking for patterns and by developing subtopics**
5. **Develop a thesis or purpose statement**
6. **Write the paper**
7. **Review your work**

# Connected Papers

Connected Papers is a tool for thought to help researchers and applied scientists find and explore papers relevant to their field of work in a visual way. You enter an origin paper, and they generate a graph. To achieve this, they analyse about 50,000 research papers, and select the ones with the strongest connections to the origin paper.

Created by Alex Tarnavsky, Eitan Eddie Smolyansky, and Itay Knaan Harpaz from Israel, Connected Papers started as a weekend side project. But when the three friends realised how useful it was in their own research, and how their friends and colleagues kept on asking to use it, they decided to release the tool for the public.
